An app to educate customers around the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Using data from https://mci.textileexchange.org/

It takes on average 10,000 litres of water to cultivate just one kilogram of raw cotton4, the material used in a third of textiles produced globally (and which represents 90 per cent of all natural fibres used).

3250 liters – How much water it takes to produce the cotton needed for one t-shirt – that is almost three years’ worth of drinking water. (WWF).

8183 liters – The gallons of water to grow enough cotton to produce just one pair jeans. (Tree Hugger).

113 billion liters –The water required for one year’s worth of global textile production (including cotton farming). (Elle MacArthur Foundation).

5.9 trillion liters – The amount of water used each year for fabric dyeing alone. (World Resources Institute).

Somebody take a url - enters - spit back how much per kg - spit back based on product
